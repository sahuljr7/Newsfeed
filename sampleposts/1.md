## Gopi Thotakura: India's First Space Tourist

Gopi Thotakura, an entrepreneur and pilot, is poised to make history as the first Indian space tourist aboard Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin's NS-25 mission.


Thotakura joins a select group of six crew members for the mission, securing his place as India's inaugural space tourist and the second Indian to venture beyond Earth's atmosphere, following Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984.

The specific launch date for the mission remains undisclosed, according to the aerospace company.

This mission marks the seventh human flight for the New Shepard program and the 25th in its history, with 31 humans flown above the Karman line, the conventional boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space.

Developed by Blue Origin, New Shepard is a fully reusable sub-orbital launch vehicle aimed at space tourism.

Thotakura, described by Blue Origin as a pilot and aviator with a passion for flying since his youth, co-founded Preserve Life Corp, a holistic wellness and health center near Atlanta International Airport.

Apart from commercial jet piloting, Thotakura handles bush, aerobatic, and seaplanes, as well as gliders and hot air balloons, and has experience as an international medical jet pilot. His recent exploits include summiting Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.

Born in Andhra Pradesh, Thotakura is an alumnus of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

The NS-25 mission's crew also includes Mason Angel, Sylvain Chiron, Kenneth L. Hess, Carol Schaller, and former Air Force Captain Ed Dwight, the nation's first Black astronaut candidate selected by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.

During the flight, each astronaut will carry a postcard to space on behalf of Blue Origin's foundation, Club for the Future, which aims to inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEAM fields.

From an environmental perspective, Blue Origin highlights that nearly 99% of New Shepard's dry mass is reused, and its engine, fueled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen, emits only water vapor with no carbon emissions during flight.
